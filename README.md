# NHL-Teams-Stats
This is an "end-of-phase" project that I am conducting within the Flatiron School curriculum. For this project, I will be looking at NHL statistics for each team from the past 3 seasons, which can be found on the NHL website. With this I will be asking five descriptive questions and 3 inferential questions and presenting my findings.
